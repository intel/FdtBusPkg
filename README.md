# FdtBusPkg - Devicetree-based Platform Device Driver Development for Tiano UEFI.

This repo implements support for developing Tiano platform device drivers
compliant to the UEFI Driver Model, by performing driver binding and
configuration using a Devicetree. Such a Devicetree is typically
either passed to UEFI by higher-privileged firmware.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a staging branch created as part of the ongoing
> [RISE](https://riseproject.dev/) collaboration. The net goal is to
> upstream to TianoCore edk2 and the UEFI Specification.

Advantages:
- Allows UEFI developers to fully embrace modularity and code reuse.
- Facilitates development of complex (graphics, NIC, etc) drivers.
- Enables a single firmware binary to work across SoC revisions and
  board designs.

FdtBusPkg consists of FdtBusDxe, a bus driver, and a number
of examples drivers and libraries for demoing with the RISC-V
OVMF firmware. FdtBusDxe is responsible for enumerating
DT controllers based on Devicetree nodes, and implementing
`EFI_DT_IO_PROTOCOL` for basic operations on such controllers, such as
device property access, register I/O, DMA buffer handling and child
device enumeration.

See further documentation:
- [FdtBusPkg Documentation Style and Terms Definitions](Docs/StyleAndTerms.md)
- [Devicetree Device Drivers](Docs/DeviceDrivers.md)
- [EFI Devicetree I/O Protocol](Docs/DtIoProtocol.md)
- [EFI-Specific Devicetree Bindings](Docs/UefiDtBindings.md)
- [FdtBusDxe Overview](Docs/FdtBusDxe.md)
- [Another README for Developers](Docs/Developers.md)

FdtBusPkg components can be used on any architecture, but have been
developed and tested with RISC-V. They should be reusable out of the box
on AArch64 platforms as well, barring any missing dependencies.

Note: this is Devicetree being used internally by UEFI. There is no
relation to using Devicetree as possible mechanism of describing
hardware configuration to an OS.

## Quick Start

To build RISC-V OVMF firmware enabled with FdtBusPkg components:

        $ git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git
        $ cd edk2
        $ git submodule add https://github.com/intel/FdtBusPkg
        $ git submodule update --init --recursive
        $ . edksetup.sh
        $ git am FdtBusPkg/Docs/0001-RiscVVirt-Patches-to-enable-FdtBusPkg-components.patch
        $ git am FdtBusPkg/Docs/0001-UefiDevicePathLib-support-DT-.-device-path-nodes.patch
        $ git am FdtBusPkg/Docs/0001-OvmfPkg-RiscVVirt-change-for-testing-HighMemDxe.patch
        $ export GCC_RISCV64_PREFIX=... (if you are on a non-RISCV64 system)
        $ build -a RISCV64  -p OvmfPkg/RiscVVirt/RiscVVirtQemu.dsc -t GCC -b DEBUG
